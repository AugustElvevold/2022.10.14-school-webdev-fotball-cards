# Football Cards Web Project

This project was developed as part of an "arbeidskrav" (mandatory coursework) for the DS3103 Web Development course, prior to the final exam. It is a simple static website that showcases football players and includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates skills in front-end development, focusing on responsive design, semantic coding, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and data management with local storage.
